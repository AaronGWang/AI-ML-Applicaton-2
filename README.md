# AI-ML-Applicaton-2
This Github page contains all the information you need to complete the second part of the AI and ML Group application. This will be a course + assignment task, where you are given three/four courses to work through, and will be presented with a task before the winter break.

Please read the following information and follow the steps carefully so that you don't miss anything important!

## Software Download:
There are a few things we need to download if you haven't already. (Latest version of python, numpy, pandas, matplotlib & an IDE)

### 1. Python Download:
Go to the Python Website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Please make sure you are downloading the newest version of python. (should be above version 3.10)

### 2. Check for pip Package Manager:
Open your terminal app on mac and type the following statement: pip3 --version

pip is a package manager for python, so you can download any libraries or extensions with it. After clicking enter when executing the line above, you should see this screen.

### 3. Downloading Jupyter (optional if you have an IDE already):
Jupyter or Jupyter notebook is a local hosted workspace that is easy to set up, and allows you to instantly start writting code in python. An IDE is basically a workspace for writting code, so if you are new to coding, please follow these steps. Even if you have an IDE already, we recommend you download jupyter too.

To download Jupyter Notebook, open your terminal on mac and type the following statement: pip3 install jupyter

Your screen will look like this if this is your first time downloading jupyter, just wait till the text stops generating.

Once your download finishes, test out jupyter notebook by typing in your terminal the following statement: jupyter notebook

It should open a local host page in your browser that looks like this:

***Congratulations you have successfully downloaded jupyter notebook! (Please reference the last section to learn how to use jupyter)***

### 4. Downloading Libraries:
This should be the final step for downloading, where we will download all the libraries including numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.

Type in your terminal on mac the following statement to install numpy: pip3 install numpy

There will be a similar loading screen to when you downloaded jupyter notebook if this is your first time. Wait till the text stops generating.

Then, Type in your terminal on mac the following statement to install pandas: pip3 install pandas

Wait for the download to finish.

Finally, Type in your terminal on mac the following statement to install matplotlib: pip3 install matplotlib

***Please reference the last section to learn how to test out these libraries in your IDE***

## Courses:
Here are the courses you should follow. 

### Python Courses:
There are two python courses we recommend, if you are completely or basically new to coding, I recommend at least taking the four hour course, and if you have time, take the six hour one. For more experienced coders, the six hour course might help refresh some of your memory. These are optional if you are confident in your current ability.

1. [4h BEGINNER Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw)
2. [6h INTERMEDIATE Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGOBQPFzWKo)

Some things to note:
- You don't have to remember EVERYTHING in these videos, it is impossible to remember all syntax (how the code is written).
- It is good to code along (copy their code by writing it yourself), and save all the files on your computer for later access.
- It is more important to learn the underlying methods and logic rather than memorizing syntax (Google exists for a reason).

### Library Courses:
These three shorter courses give you an overview of how the libraries listed above (numpy, pandas & matplotlib) are used. Please follow the courses in order, as the later ones might require the previous. Also, you MUST finish the python courses before starting these if you are a beginner to coding.

1. [1h Numpy Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JUAPgtkKpI)
2. [1h Pandas Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEHCJofslg)
3. [1.5h Matplotlib Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xc3CA655Y4)

Some things to note:
- Coding along is very much advised especially if this is new to you.
- Again, you don't have to memorize EVERYTHING, but remembering the basics and knowing the logic should be the focus.

### Final Note for Courses:
There is a good bit of material to work through, but you are given plenty of time to complete it. If your a beginner, please don't be overwhelmed, as you will have many other chances to strengthen and practice these skills. You might need to do a little extra digging if a concept in a video is unfamiliar, but just try your best, that is most important.

It is important to manage your time and allocate them accordingly, you have over 4 weeks to complete these courses + 2 weeks to complete the assignment (which will be released before winter break).
